Thesis template in Markdown, uses [LUT guidelines](https://uni.lut.fi/en/web/lut.fi-eng/master-s-thesis-project4). Adapted from https://github.com/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown by Tom Pollard, head over to original repository for more information on how this template is organized and what requirements there are.

You may view example of generated PDF in `output/thesis.pdf`.

I have very limited understanding on LaTeX, so there are most likely many definitions and hacks that could be done better. If something breaks, you may keep all the pieces.

# Requirements
